# Data set-up

## Setting up the `user_data.csv` file

Simply create a new CSV file in this folder and paste the following text on the first line: 
    `practice_date,topic_selected,confidence_level,target_time_seconds,expectation_comparison`

The app will fail if this file hasn't been set up, and will prompt you to set it up if the file hasn't been created at all.

## Setting up the `user_categories.csv` file
Simply create a new CSV file in this folder with a column heading `category`. Fill in categories on subsequent lines, with a new category per line, if you wish.

The app will fail if this file hasn't been set up, and will prompt you to set it up if it doesn't exist.
